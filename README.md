## Description
In on the Joke...? is a game where you play as an audience member in a comedy club. The gag is, that you can't understand what the comedian is saying! He speaks in gibberish and random symbols so you have to watch the audience to know when you should laugh at his jokes. When you laugh at the correct times, you get points! If you laugh while the comedian is talking or you laugh at a joke that didn't land, you lose points.
